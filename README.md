# Discord Webhook Backend

This is a backend for one of my webhooks that runs in my Discord server. This project revolves around the Minecraft Realms server I have. Using this webhook, I can easier send messages using the webhook and remind my friends to participate by paying their shares of it. It communicates with a React-based GUI project I created from which I can send messages to the webhook using POST fetching. Currently, it has two routes, the first one handles message sending while the second one gets the player data I have set up in my GUI project and sends a message specifying the players who have not yet paid their share.

The project will be linked to this readme when I get it published on GitHub!

## Can I use it?

If you happen to need exactly this kind of webhook setup, then by all means! It is also very easy to customize to fit your own needs :)
